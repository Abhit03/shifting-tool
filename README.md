## Description
An interactive demand side management tool for electricity utilities to assess savings from demand response given certain facts. Built using d3.js and JavaScript.

## Usage
The tool is live at [this page](http://sharedelectric.com/shifting).

You could also clone the repo and merely open up index.html with the same folder structure, because Webpack would be overkill.
